<p> One of the collest animals in the grass land is the black rhino. This massive creature can weigh upto 1,800 – 3,100 lbs as well as be 4.3 – 5.9 ft and have the life span of 35 – 50 years! Because of their height, black rhinos have a 'prehensile', meaning hooked, lip for pulling leaves off branches. They even run on their toes. Their diet consist of leafy plants, branches, shoots, thorny wood bushes, and fruit.Black rhinos can eat up to 54 kilograms of food per day! But what could eat a rhino? Nothing! The black rhino has no preadots execpt for humans, but sadly they are endangered because humans over hunt for the horns. So we need to take more care of them!</p>
